        <h3>Database and SQL Course</h3>
        <p>
            I had read a lot about backend data management before this beginning this course so it was awesome to
            finally see work with data. We used MySQL with SSMS for most of this course. I practiced a lot of queries
            using the large AdventureWorks2017 database and practice building and modifying my own mini databases. This
            course was really enjoyable and a big breakthrough for my overall understanding of full-stack software
            development.

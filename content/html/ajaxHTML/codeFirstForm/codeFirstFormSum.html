    <h3>EF Form Code First Project</h3>
    <p>
        This was a project challenge I completed during my Boot Camp. This form utilizes the Entity Framework code-first
        approach. It is a simple application demonstrating CRUD capabilities using EF and LINQ. It was awesome to use
        this framework. It seems so much more streamlined and efficient than writing MySQL queries.

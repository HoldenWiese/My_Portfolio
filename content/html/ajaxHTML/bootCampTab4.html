        <h3>Version Control Course</h3>
        <p>
            Version control is awesome! I was familiar with it before this course, but after practicing it
            it in-depth I was able to see the value of it much more clearly. We learned using Git with the Bash
            Console and GitHub. Later on in the Boot Camp, we used Azure DevOps when working as a team. I use Git
            repositories for every project and document I create now.

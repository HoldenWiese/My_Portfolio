        <h3>JavaScript Course</h3>
        <p>
            Becoming familiar with JavaScript was challenging at first, but lots of fun after getting the hang of it.
            This course focussed a lot on using JS in the front end, but I also began to practice algorithms challenges
            using it. I've spent a lot of time studying JavaScript since this course.
        </p>

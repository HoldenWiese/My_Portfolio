            <p>My name is Holden Wiese and I was born and raised in Sandy, Utah. My family has always been important to
                me and even today, my brother and sister are two of the best friends I have.
                <br><br>
                I worked hard in highschool and spent my freetime with friends snowboarding, skateboarding, and
                rock climbing.
                I went to Utah State University for a year where I completed most of my general
                courses and from there, I went to work at a computer store where I learned a lot and
                developed a passion for computers.
                <br><br>
                After a year I decided to serve and ecclesiastical mission. I went to Virginia and North Carolina and spent
                2 years there teaching and giving service to the people.
                After returning home I completed my remaining general courses at Utah Valley University and graduated a
                Web Development Bootcamp with The Tech Academy.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I am working at a rock climbing gym in Salt Lake City and studying in pursuit of a career in
                programming.

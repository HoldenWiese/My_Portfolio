    <h3>Computer and Technology Basics Course</h3>
    <p>This course taught me a lot about basic definitions and concepts related to technology and computers. A lot of
        this course was a review for me, but other parts were brand new. My favorite part of this course was learning
        about different number systems and doing binary arithmetic.

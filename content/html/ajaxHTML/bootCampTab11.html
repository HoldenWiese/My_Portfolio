        <h3>Live Projects at The Tech Academy</h3>
        <p>
            I worked with a team for 6 weeks of my time at The Tech Academy. We did 2-week sprints with daily standups.
            Each of these projects was very challenging by design. I was given tasks that developers would face in
            professional settings and I was responsible for completing them in a timely manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first sprint I completed focussed on front-end web design. I worked with a team on an ASP.NET MVC web
            application designed for construction management. During this course, I used HTML helper, CSS, and
            JavaScript daily. I did a lot to improve animations throughout the website and created an image map that
            customers could interact with to go to different links.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second sprint was on a project utilizing Python and the Django Framework. Prior to this project, I
            practiced creating some simple Django projects utilizing SQLite. When I began the project I was tasked with
            implementing a 3rd party API for users to interact with as well as a data scraper.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last project I worked on utilized C# in an ASP.NET MVC framework. This web app allowed a theatre company
            to manage productions and gave users access to information and reservations. I learned a lot here and became
            much more confident in my understanding of web development and C#.
        </p>
        <p>

            These live projects were the most valuable part of my time at the boot camp. They were extremely
            challenging, but that's why they were so rewarding.

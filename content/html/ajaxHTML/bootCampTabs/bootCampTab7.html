        <h3>Python Course</h3>
        <p>
            The Python course was awesome for solidifying my understanding of the ideas taught in the Software
            Development Course. I practiced using classes, inheritance, encapsulation, abstract classes, and data
            structures here as well as some other concepts that were new to me. We spent a lot of time learning the
            Django Framework. This was my first time using a web development framework. It was very confusing at first,
            but after hours of practice with it, I could see how helpful it would be for building a large web
            application.

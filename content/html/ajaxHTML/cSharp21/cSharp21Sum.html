    <h3>Console App Demonstrating Many C# Tools</h3>
    <p>
        This project was awesome. This 21 game demonstrates the use of a lot of the tools available to C#
        developers. Throughout this solution concepts such as method overloading, operator overloading,
        overriding, abstract classes, inheritance, generics, enum, lambdas, constructors chaining, exception
        handling, and much more.

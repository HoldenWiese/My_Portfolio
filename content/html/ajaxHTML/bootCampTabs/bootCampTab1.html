    <h3>Coding Boot Camp</h3>
    <p>
        I worked hard to try and teach myself how to become a programmer. I was learning a lot, but I wasn't sure I was on the
        right path. I wanted more structure to build my education on so I decided to enroll in a boot camp.

        After weeks of research, I enrolled at The Tech Academy. Their reviews were fantastic and they answered all my endless
        questions. I made a big financial investment and eventually completed the "Software Developer Boot Camp".

        At times it was very difficult, but today I'm so glad I did it. I feel confident in my ability to succeed as a developer.

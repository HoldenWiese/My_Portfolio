    <h3>Coding Boot Camp</h3>
    <p>
        I worked hard to try and teach myself how to become a programmer. I was learning a lot, but I wasn't sure I was
        on
        the right path. I wanted more structure to build my education on so I
        decided to enroll in a boot camp.
    </p>
    <p>
        After weeks of research, I enrolled at The Tech Academy. Their
        reviews were fantastic and they answered all my endless questions. I made a big financial investment and
        eventually completed the "Software Developer Boot Camp".
    </p>
    <p>At times it was very difficult, but today I'm so glad I did it. I feel confident in my ability to succeed as a
        developer.</p>

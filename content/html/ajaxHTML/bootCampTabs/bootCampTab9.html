        <h3>C# and .NET Framework Course</h3>
        <p>
            This was by far my favorite course! I loved working with a strongly typed language. C# brought everything I
            had learned together. This course was more in-depth and more time consuming, but I loved every minute of it.
            We created ASP.NET projects utilizing MVC. We also integrated databases into our websites with and without
            Entity Framework.
